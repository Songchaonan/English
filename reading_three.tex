\par From this article ,I learnt why Smartphones so important like that.Smartphones matter partly because of their ubiquity.We can see from our surroundings almost everyone have a Smartphones .Smartphones have also permeate every aspect of daily life,almost everyone check messages,news headlines or other services within 15 minutes of getting up.
\par I think the bedroom is just the beginning.Smartphones is ready to enrich our lives and reshape industries.Those revolution power comes from their size and connectivity.Their size makes them  the realism personal computers.Smartphones knows where you are ,what websites you visit,whom you talk to,even how health you are.But like other technologies it also bring some bad effects,such us "text neck"and dependency.The dependency is very common problem,many people shows that they can't deviate from their phone.Smartphones also have some benefits weigh against these bad effects.First is we can use Smartphones record the brutality of our officials.The second benefit is Smartphones bring much dates,creating a more detailed view of society than has ever existed before and doing so real time.The third benefit is Smartphones can increase the rate of growth of GDP-per -person.
\par The most important problem is the protection of privacy.If citizens aren't protected from prying eyes ,some will suffer and others turn them backs. I think the government must publish some polices to protect citizens privacy.
