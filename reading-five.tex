\maketitle
\par The problem of smoking is not related to poverty and wealth, the rate of smoking are both rise in poor and rich countries.
\par Banning smoking would be wrong. It would be not only illiberal-people should be allowed to indulge in their pleasures, even lethal ones-but also ineffective. But discouraging smoking is entirely legitimate: smokers pollute the air of other people , and increasing the rates of suffering lung cancer , they even damage their family because die prematurely.
\par The most effective measure against smoking is taxation. The police makers must be careful to set the rate neither so high that it encourages smuggler, nor to low that it fails to discourage smokers. Government need to strengthen tighten their borders.Another effective measure is bans smoking in public places.
\par Sadly , according to a WHO report,  many countries still hardly any regulations to discourage smoking, and others have too many loopholes. In my opinion government need to overcome tobacco-company lobbying and enact laws to discouraging smoking.
