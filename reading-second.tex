\title{The name change of African American}
\author{Songchaonan}
\maketitle
\par
From nearly 100 years,the call for African American has experienced four phases:"Colored"¡¢"Negro"¡¢"Black"¡¢"African American".Those changes represent the freed of widespread discrimination .
\par I can fell the fact that naming any group is a politically freighted exercise.A study obviously indicate that "Back" carried connotations that were more negative than those of "African American".In addition,A recent study found that "Black"people are viewed more negative than "African American"because of a perceived difference in socioeconomic status.In another study,subjects were given a brief description of a man name Williams.To one group,he was identified as "African American"and estimated that he earned about 37000 a year and had a two-year college degree,but another group told him "Black",and estimated that he earned about 29000 a year and guessed that he was had only "some"college experience.So i can learn from this study there is still discrimination in the United States even if "African American"was used.
